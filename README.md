# **MyGive**

**Type:** CLI Tool · **Tech Stack:** Shell Scripting (POSIX/Bash) · **Status:** Completed

## **Overview**

**MyGive** was the first assignment for **COMP2041**, a scripting-based reimplementation of a lightweight assignment submission and marking system. It replicates core `give` functionalities while introducing basic automation for marking and status checking.

## **Features**

* `mygive-add` — Create a new project.
* `mygive-fetch` — Retrieve a submission file.
* `mygive-mark` — Run provided tests and record results.
* `mygive-rm` — Remove an existing project.
* `mygive-status` — Display submission status for an assignment.
* `mygive-submit` — Submit files for marking.
* `mygive-summary` — View a summary of a student's submission and marks.
* `mygive-test` — Compare program output against expected output.

## **Extras**

Includes a **custom test script** to verify correctness by comparing outputs against the example implementation.

## **Purpose**

Built to automate and simulate a submission backend using shell tools, reinforcing scripting, file manipulation, and process control concepts.
