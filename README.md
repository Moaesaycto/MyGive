# MyGive

MyGive was the first assignment in my COMP2041 course, which involved making a series of scripts that would allow students to submit assignments and have them stored. Part of the functionality included testing the outputs with given results when initialising the assignment. For this project, I also created a test script to compare my code's output with the output of the example implementation. It contained the following commands:

- `mygive-add` to create a project.
- `mygive-fetch` to retrieve a file.
- `mygive-mark` to make a file with the provided tests.
- `mygive-rm` to remove a project.
- `mygive-status` to check the status of an assignment
- `mygive-submit` to submit a project
- `mygive-summary` to get the summary of a student's assignment.
- `mygive-test` to get a file to compare outputs to the expected.
